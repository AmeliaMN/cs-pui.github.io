In 2017, I [wrote an article about finding academic happiness with **primarily-undergraduate institutions**](https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/the-jobs-i-didnt-see-my-misconceptions-of-the-academic-job-market-9cb98b057422). I continue to receive emails with the same  question: _how do I find these jobs?_ This listing of ads is meant to help navigate that muddy water. To see last year's list, [see the 20/21 version of this page](index-20.html).

This document does not contain many CS academic positions. It's intended for those who want to invest in teaching/mentorship with undergraduate students while still staying active in their scholarship. 

{% capture criteria %}
**Criteria:** the positions on this page should be...
- accessible to those with a Ph.D. in CS (or closely related field)
- Universities that identify as **primarily-undergraduate institutions**.
- Institutions that highly value teaching, but also _secure time and financial resources for faculty to remain engaged with research_. This typically means a reduced teaching load (often 3/2 or 2/2) with professional support funds.
{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice-gray">{{ criteria | markdownify }}</div>

If you are considering entering the job market, I'd encourage you to visit the [**Resources**](resources.html) pages for some insight into the ways in which PUIs might differ in their interviewing processes and values.

While I provide rough guidelines on teaching/scholarship balance, the schools here still cover a wide range of research resources and teaching loads. **Always ask questions**
