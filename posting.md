If you belong to a CS department (or just happen to catch a listing before I do), you can [**submit pull requests to add your own information.**](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)


**Steps:** the positions on this page should be...
1. _Make sure your department and university aligns with the criteria_. I'd prefer to give everyone the benefit of the doubt and not act as a filter. [see the criteria](index#criteria)
2. Edit [`deadlines.md`](https://github.com/cs-pui/cs-pui.github.io/blob/master/_includes/deadlines.md) with your application deadline [see more instructions](faq#scope)
3. Edit [`descriptions.md`](https://github.com/cs-pui/cs-pui.github.io/blob/master/_includes/descriptions.md) with an excerpt from your ad, location, link, and deadline. 

Feel free to email me at `evan.peck@bucknell.edu` if you run into any problems or need help with the process. I'm happy to add information for people who don't feel comfortable with the pull request process.
