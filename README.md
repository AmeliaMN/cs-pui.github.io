## Repository for CS-PUI

This website uses Jekyll (plus some CSS that I wrote) to translate markdown into the nicer website that you see at [https://cs-pui.github.io/](https://cs-pui.github.io/). It is primarily maintained by [Evan Peck](https://evanpeck.github.io/)


- If you see an error, an issue, or would like to add a resource, feel free to submit a pull request or email me at `evan.peck@bucknell.edu`. 
- If you would like to create a job ad on this site, please read the instructions at [https://cs-pui.github.io/posting.html](https://cs-pui.github.io/posting.html)
