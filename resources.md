While I don't expect to have a lengthy resources list here, there are a couple I want to highlight because they include wisdom from CS faculty at PUIs:

- Dr. Iris Howley's (Williams College) [**Some Resources for the Primarily Undergraduate Institution Computer Science Job Market**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JGyp7_NJKDAjCpsm8Z5_lty0P76jk3bhPPMdQJaF0nw/edit?usp=sharing): Provides links to lots of different resources related to faculty positions at CS primarily-undergraduate institutions. 

- [**(Podcast) Primarily Undergraduate Institutions with Iris Howley**](https://csedpodcast.org/blog/s3ep10_primarily_undergraduate_institutions/): Dr. Iris Howley (Williams College) talks about PUIs with Dr. Kristin Stephens-Martinez on the CS-Ed Podcast.

- [**Computer Science Graduate Job and Interview Guide**](https://csguides.github.io/grad-job-guide/): while less specifically focused on PUIs, Dr. Kevin Angstadt provides detailed notes and perspective from his experiences applying to PUIs. 

- Dr. Phil Chodrow's (Middlebury College) [**CS Jobs at Small Liberal Arts Colleges**](https://www.philchodrow.com/job_app.html): Phil includes some tips from his recent application experience, and includes his application material. 

- Dr. Amanda Stent's (Colby College) [**Academic CS Careers at Liberal Arts Colleges**](https://medium.com/@ajstent/academic-cs-careers-at-liberal-arts-colleges-917b0d3e82ab): Amanda writes a nice FAQ outlining life as a CS prof at liberal arts colleges, inclusing application guidance.
