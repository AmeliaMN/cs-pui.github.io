While I don't expect to have a lengthy resources list here, there are a couple I want to highlight because they compile wisdom from many people (including those who have gone onto PUIs):

- Iris Howley's (Williams) [Some Resources for the Primarily Undergraduate Institution Computer Science Job Market](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JGyp7_NJKDAjCpsm8Z5_lty0P76jk3bhPPMdQJaF0nw/edit?usp=sharing): Provides links to lots of different resources related to faculty positions at CS primarily-undergraduate institutions. 

- [Computer Science Graduate Job and Interview Guide](https://csguides.github.io/grad-job-guide/): while less specifically focused on PUIs, Kevin Angstadt provides detailed notes and perspective from his experiences applying to PUIs. 


_If you come across other resources, [submit a pull request on this page](https://github.com/cs-pui/cs-pui.github.io/blob/master/resources.md) or email me at `evan.peck@bucknell.edu`_
