# Resources for navigating the job market
While I don't expect to have a lengthy resources list here, there are a couple I want to highlight because they compile wisdom from many people (including those who have gone onto PUIs).
- [Computer Science Graduate Job and Interview Guide](https://csguides.github.io/grad-job-guide/)
- Iris Howley's (Williams) [Some Resources for the Primarily Undergraduate Institution Computer Science Job Market](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JGyp7_NJKDAjCpsm8Z5_lty0P76jk3bhPPMdQJaF0nw/edit?usp=sharing)
