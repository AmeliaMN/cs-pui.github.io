While I don't expect to have a lengthy resources list here, there are a couple I want to highlight because they include wisdom from CS faculty at PUIs:

- Dr. Iris Howley's (Williams) [**Some Resources for the Primarily Undergraduate Institution Computer Science Job Market**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JGyp7_NJKDAjCpsm8Z5_lty0P76jk3bhPPMdQJaF0nw/edit?usp=sharing): Provides links to lots of different resources related to faculty positions at CS primarily-undergraduate institutions. 

- [**Computer Science Graduate Job and Interview Guide**](https://csguides.github.io/grad-job-guide/): while less specifically focused on PUIs, Dr. Kevin Angstadt provides detailed notes and perspective from his experiences applying to PUIs. 

- Dr. Phil Chodrow's (Middlebury) [**CS Jobs at Small Liberal Arts Colleges**](https://www.philchodrow.com/job_app.html): Phil includes some tips from his recent application experience, and includes his application material. 


_If you come across other resources, [submit a pull request on this page](https://github.com/cs-pui/cs-pui.github.io/blob/master/resources.md) or email me at `evan.peck@bucknell.edu`_
