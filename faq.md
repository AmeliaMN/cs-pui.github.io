# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

#### ❓ Who maintains this site? 
This is primarily run by Evan Peck 

#### ❓ How much does this cost for departments to post? 
Nothing. It's free. 

#### ❓ Does anyone look at it or use it? 
During the 2021-2022 CS hiring season, the website attracted approximately 10,000 visits. While it's hard to quantify the impact of those views, I get emails from a set of people each year hearing that it made an impact either on (1) a department's applicant pool (and ultimately, hiring), or (2) a candidate's applications (and final home). I'd like to think that's pretty good impact-per-dollar-spent.

#### ❓ What did the list look like in previous years? 
This is the 5th year I'll be keeping track of CS PUI positions. 
- [2021-2022 Hiring Cycle]
- [2020-2021 Hiring Cycle](https://cs-pui.github.io/index-20.html) - The first year of this site. Note that this was during our pandemic-disrupted hiring year.
- [2019-2020 Hiring Cycle](https://evanmpeck.medium.com/cs-academic-job-market-for-liberal-arts-colleges-19-20-cd348423f919) - 
- [2018-2019 Hiring Cycle](https://mobile.twitter.com/EvanMPeck/status/1040402908657934336) - I initially kept track of positions via a Twitter thread

#### ❓ Why limited it to just permanent/tenure-track positions - what about teaching-track faculty or fixed-term positions? We need those too! 
I agree! Unfortunately, this site is curated for free on top of my normal faculty duties. As a result, I need to limit the scope to keep it manageable. Expanding the scope isn't just an expansion in number of advertisement, but also a challenging expansion in curation criteria. For example, I suspect that many fixed-term positions at PUIs don't practically set aside enough time for scholarship due to increased teaching loads. This makes those positions _much_ harder to filter. Simply put, in order to expad, I need more help (and possibly some funding). 

#### ❓ How do I know whether my institution has enough emphasis on research? 
There really isn't a hard set of rules here. However, many schools on our list have: 
- _Reduced teaching load_ (in comparison to full-teaching colleges): The average teaching load is probably somewhere between a 2-2 or 3-2 (depending on how they define it). With only rare exceptions, 3-3 is a good rule-of-thumb upper limit.  
- _Startup packages:_ While not in the realm of R1s, most institutions offer funds to kick-start research.
- _Untenured leave:_ Most offer a pre-tenure leave of 1 or 2 semesters to help faculty invest in research 
- _Internal research resources:_ This often includes some travel support for conferences and significant internal support for summer undergraduate research. 

#### ❓ Can I put my school on the list if we have some grad students?  
There is a lot of muddy ground here. In general, I don't include programs that graduate Ph.D. students.Most of the schools here either don't have Masters students _or_ graduate so few each year that they qualify as a liberal arts college. That being said, there are some schools on this list each year that are intensely undergraduate-focused even with larger Masters programs (and seem to have many other characteristics that look like a PUI). I'm happy to include those institutions.
